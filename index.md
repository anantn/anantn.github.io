Hello there and thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet!

My name is Anant, and I'm a hacker ([the good kind!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28programmer_subculture%29)). I have a special affinity towards free software in particular. I've participated in several such projects since 2004 and [continue to](http://github.com/anantn) [do so](http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/anant).

I completed a Masters in Parallel and Distributed Computer Systems at the [Vrije Universiteit](http://vu.nl/), [Amsterdam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam); and a Bachelors in Computer Engineering at [MNIT](http://www.mnit.ac.in/), [Jaipur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur). After working on a range of experimental projects at [Mozilla Labs](http://mozillalabs.com/), I joined [Firebase](http://firebase.com) as the 5th employee and almost all my time is currently devoted to the startup.

If you're looking to get in touch with me, the best way is to send me an email: [anant@kix.in](mailto:anant@kix.in). If you prefer a more instant form of communication, I sometimes lurk on the [Freenode IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/) network under the nickname _KillerX_ (don't ask), or on the [Mozilla IRC](irc://irc.mozilla.org/) network simply as _anant_.

The opinions expressed on this website are mine alone and nobody, including my employer, necessarily agrees with them.
