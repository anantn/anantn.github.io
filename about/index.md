Hi.

My name is Anant, and I'm a hacker ([of the good variety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28programmer_subculture%29)).
The best way to reach me is [by email](mailto:anant@kix.in).

I have a special affinity towards free software in particular. I've participated and contributed to several open source
projects since 2004 and [continue to](http://github.com/anantn) [do so](http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/anant).

I currently work at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) with a focus on building enterprise scale knowledge graphs.
My last job was at [Ozlo](https://www.ozlo.com), where we built an AI-powered digital assistant.
Previously, at [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), I helped build a scalable realtime
application backend. Before that, I worked on a wide range of experimental projects to improve the web at
[Mozilla Labs](http://www.mozillalabs.com/).

The opinions expressed on this website are solely my own and do not reflect the views or opinions of any other party,
including my current and former employers.

I studied Parallel and Distributed Computer Systems at the
[Vrije Universiteit](http://www.vu.nl/en/programmes/international-masters/programmes/n-q/parallel-and-distributed-computer-systems-msc/index.asp)
in Amsterdam, and hold a Bachelors in Computer Engineering from [MNIT](http://www.mnit.ac.in/), Jaipur.
