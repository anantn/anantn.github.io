[Plan 9](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/) is a research system developed at the [Bell Labs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_labs).
Designed to be the successor for the UNIX operating system, it makes up for many of the mistakes that UNIX made -
offering a completely new way of looking at operating and distributed systems. Plan 9 was written from scratch,
and emphasizes on high code quality with minimal complexity.

Plan 9's latest release is it's fourth edition. This site is a mirror for the
