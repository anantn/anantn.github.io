Mozilla holds a special place in my heart: they were my gateway into Silicon Valley. I worked on a number of Mozilla projects in various capacities, first as a volunteer, then as an intern, and finally as a full-time employee for [Mozilla Labs](https://labs.mozilla.org/).

Perhaps my most significant contribution while at Mozilla was [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/), where I served as Mozilla's rep to the W3C and IETF during standardization efforts. I was co-editor for two W3C specifications: ["WebRTC"](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/) as well as ["Media Capture and Streams"](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/). Additionally, I led implementation efforts for _getUserMedia_ in Firefox. Interestingly, this may also have been my most impactful contribution in the industry to date: WebRTC is in very wide use, ranging from [Messenger](https://webrtchacks.com/facebook-webrtc/) to [Discord](https://blog.discordapp.com/how-discord-handles-two-and-half-million-concurrent-voice-users-using-webrtc-ce01c3187429), a significant portion of internet video/audio calling traffic uses parts or whole of the WebRTC spec and codebase.

I also spent a lot of my time working on various parts of [Firefox Sync](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/accounts/), which was still called "Weave" during incubation at Mozilla Labs. Sync is a privacy-first browser data synchronization solution. Aside from this, I made minor contributions to other active Mozilla Labs projects at the time, which included the Mozilla [web app marketplace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/Marketplace) and [Persona](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/Persona) (a decentralized identity and sign-in solution).
