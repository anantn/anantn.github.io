After contributing code for proper signal handling in [GNU Parted](https://www.gnu.org/software/parted/), I was briefly the maintainer of the project for a little over a year. Parted is a partition manager and is widely used on most Linux distributions, notably in the default installer for Ubuntu.

Thanks are due to [Leslie Patrick Polzer](https://wiki.debian.org/LesliePolzer) for his encouragement and help with my involvement in the project.
