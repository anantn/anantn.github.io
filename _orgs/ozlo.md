I was one of the first employees at Ozlo, a startup focused on building an AI-powered digital assistant.
I worked on a number of aspects of the product, most significantly building a large scale data pipeline to
construct and serve the knowledge graph used by it to answer questions. We built a graph containing 500M+
of the most popular people, places, and things. Ozlo was acquired by Facebook in 2017.
