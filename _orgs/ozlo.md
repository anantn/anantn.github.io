I was one of the first employees at Ozlo, a startup focused on building an
[AI-powered digital assistant](/2016/05/12/meet-ozlo/).
I worked on a number of aspects of the product, most significantly building a large scale data pipeline to
construct and serve the knowledge graph used by it to answer questions. We built a graph containing 500M+
of the most popular people, places, and things. Ozlo was
[acquired by Facebook](https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/31/facebook-buys-ozlo-to-boost-its-conversational-ai-efforts/) in 2017.
