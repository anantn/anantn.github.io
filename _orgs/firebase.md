I was the fifth employee at <a href="https://firebase.google.com">Firebase</a>, a startup building a cutting-edge
real-time database and developer tooling to make app development easy. I wore a number of hats, but was primarily responsible
for developer evangelism and support.

I built pivotal integrations with frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/angular/angularfire">AngularJS</a>,
and bootstrapped a static hosting service. Firebase was acquired by Google in 2014 has continued to grow as part
of their cloud platform, now serving over 3 million developers worldwide.
