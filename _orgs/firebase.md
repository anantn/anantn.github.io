As an early employee at Firebase, I ran the developer evangelism, support, and framework integration efforts. I authored the original version of [AngularFire](https://github.com/angular/angularfire), among other JS framework integrations like Ember and React.

I also prototyped the first version of [static hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/) during a hack week, which is still a core part of the Firebase offering. Firebase was acquired by Google in 2014, integrated into Google's cloud services portfolio.
