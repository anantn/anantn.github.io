I'm currently employed by [Meta](https://www.meta.com/) (n√©e Facebook) as an Engineering Director.
I oversee and support a global set of engineering teams, helping bring exciting new product experiences to life
on our next-generation [smart glasses](https://tech.facebook.com/2023/2/the-making-of-ray-ban-stories/).

Prior to my current role I led the engineering teams responsible for building our
[voice assistant](https://www.vox.com/recode/22948097/mark-zuckerberg-voice-assistant-metaverse-ai-announcement)
product experiences. We shipped the Assistant on a slew of Meta's hardware products, including
[Portal](https://about.fb.com/news/2018/10/introducing-portal/),
[Oculus Quest](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/in-vr-experiences/oculus-features/using-voice-commands/), and
[Ray-Ban Stories](https://www.meta.com/help/ray-ban-stories/articles/assistant/use-voice-commands-with-hey-facebook-on-ray-ban-stories/).

I also built and led the team behind the [Facebook Knowledge Graph](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3332266).
This graph was used to power a variety of applications for hundreds of millions of users, ranging from search in the blue app
to the voice assistant for our hardware products.
