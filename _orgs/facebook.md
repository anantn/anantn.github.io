I'm currently employed by <a href="https://www.meta.com/">Meta</a> (n√©e Facebook), as an Engineering Director.
I oversee and support a global set of engineering teams, helping bring exciting new product experiences to life
on our next-generation <a href="https://tech.facebook.com/2023/2/the-making-of-ray-ban-stories/">smart glasses</a>.

Prior to my current role I led the teams responsible for building our
<a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22948097/mark-zuckerberg-voice-assistant-metaverse-ai-announcement">voice assistant</a> product experiences. I also built and led the team behind the <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3332266">Facebook Knowledge Graph</a>.
This graph was used to power a variety of applications for hundreds of millions of users, ranging from search in the blue app
to the voice assistant for our hardware products.
