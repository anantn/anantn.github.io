[PHP-GTK](http://gtk.php.net/) was my first foray into open source. It initially caught my eye while trying to build a UI application for my university, and I eventually ended up contributing tutorials and documentation for the project.

I am so grateful to the maintainers of the project: [Christian Weiske](https://cweiske.de), [Andrei Zmievski](http://zmievski.org/about/), [Steph Fox](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/stephfox), and [Scott Mattocks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottmattocks/). I couldn't have asked for a better set of people to onboard me into the world of open source and professional programming more broadly.
