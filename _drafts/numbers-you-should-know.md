title: Numbers You Should Know
---

I've observed in the recent past that it's very helpful to keep a rough count of people, places and things in the world.

Peter Norvig first suggested the importance of [knowing certain numbers](http://norvig.com/21-days.html#answers) in his famous quip: "Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years". I suggest there are more numbers you should keep track of.

## People

The first of these is simply a count of how many people there are in the world.

<div class="table table-left">
|---
|   Region			| Population						 | Growth         |
|:-|-:|:-
| The World		| $$ 7.13 \times 10^9 $$ | $$ 1.1\% $$ |
| China				| $$ 1.36 \times 10^9 $$ | $$ 0.5\% $$ |
| India					| $$ 1.29 \times 10^9 $$ | $$ 1.2\% $$ |
| USA					| $$ 3.22 \times 10^8 $$ | $$ 0.7\% $$ |
| Indonesia			| $$ 2.50 \times 10^8 $$ | $$ 1.2\% $$ |
| Brazil					| $$ 2.02 \times 10^8 $$ | $$ 0.9\% $$ |

This is obviously the theoretical maximum market size for any consumer product — but you'll also notice that releasing a product in the 5 most populated countries covers almost half the total human population.

Knowing the current value of any given metric is important, but it is more important to know the rates at which the values change. Population growth rates aren't that interesting, given they're relatively low across the board. However, it's a good habit to always ask for and remember the rate of change when any number is presented to you. (This was particularly important — for example — while considering the number of PCs & smartphones shipped in 2011, when the absolute numbers were around the same, but growth rates were drastically different.)

Depending on the domain you're working on, you'll want to track specific subsets of the human population. The most interesting of these that is also generally useful is the age demographic.

<div class="table table-right">

|   Region			| 0-14                 | 15-24               | 25-54              | 55+                  | Median    |
|:-|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
| The World		| $$ 25.8\% $$ | $$ 16.6\% $$ | $$ 40.8\% $$ | $$ 16.8\% $$ | $$ 29.4 $$ |
| China				| $$ 17.1\% $$ | $$ 14.7\% $$  | $$ 47.2\% $$ | $$ 21.0\% $$ | $$ 35.2 $$ |
| India					| $$ 28.5\% $$ | $$ 18.1\% $$  | $$ 40.6\% $$ | $$ 12.8\% $$ | $$ 25.9 $$ |
| USA					| $$ 19.3\% $$ | $$ 13.7\% $$  | $$ 39.9\% $$ | $$ 27.1\% $$ | $$ 36.9 $$ |
| Indonesia			| $$ 26.2\% $$ | $$ 17.1\% $$  | $$ 42.3\% $$ | $$ 14.4\% $$ | $$ 27.9 $$ |
| Brazil					| $$ 23.8\% $$ | $$ 16.5\% $$  | $$ 43.7\% $$ | $$ 16.0\% $$ | $$ 30.5 $$ |

India and Indonesia are relatively "young" countries, while the USA and China will experience a burgeoning elderly population in the coming decades.

Employment statistics are also important to look at. Knowing the number of actors, directors and musicians is useful for entertainment startups. If you make premium products that sell at a high margin, you'll want to know how many people work in professions that allow them to afford it.

## Places

## Things

## Insights

Keeping track of these numbers is interesting to many for it's own sake. But, having them in the back of your mind allows you to draw insights every now and then that may be useful for a variety of purposes.

Some examples:

* Storing 10 MB of data for every person on the planet will utilize roughly 71,000 TB. That's not much by today's standards — and indeed we're seeing an increasing number of technology companies offering "unlimited" storage for their customer's photos, files and documents.

* If you start with 1,000 users and every user signs up 5 of their friends every month; the whole world will be signed up to your service in under a year. This is unlikely in practice since not everyone has 60 non-overlapping friends and most of them are probably not interested in what you have to offer. Nevertheless, this gives you a glimpse of how powerful (the oft-misused term) "viral" campaigns can be.

Combining population numbers with spending patterns can also reveal potential market sizes and other useful observations. For instance:

* Consider that products focusing on things like education and entertainment will have a large addressable market in "young" countries with a low median age, while much of the focus in "older" nations will be in services like healthcare.

* Almost everywhere in the world, people aged 0-25 today will have vastly different needs in their middle age than those of the current population. Having grown in a world of ubiquitous devices collecting personal data, their focus will shift from data collection to organization and retrieval. (We're already seeing this with photo management to an extent).

I recommend committing around a dozen metrics (preferably relevant to your domain) to memory — and then updating them every 3 months or so. Updating your knowledge of these numbers on a regular basis is important because it allows you to intuitively spot trends as quickly as possible.
