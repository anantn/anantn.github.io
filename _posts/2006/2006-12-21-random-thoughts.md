Wow, been over a month since I last updated the blog. Somehow I just keep
forgetting that I have one to update, even if there's so much to tell!

[FOSS.IN](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://foss.in/)
was organized to be held Nov 24th - 26th, and it was a resounding success. I
wasn't able to attend it (because of my final semester examinations) but
from what I hear it was pretty good.

[Christian](http://www.cweiske.de/) got this nice idea of mapping PHP-GTK
users on a
[map](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://php-gtk2.de/php-gtk-users.jpg).
The idea was soon extended to PEAR too and
[here's](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://pear.php.net/map)
the result. Talking of PHP-GTK, it seems that interest in the project
has really grown. The number of people on the #php-gtk channel on Freenode
now touched a double-digit number, and we now have our very own
[community site](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://www.php-gtk.eu/). PHP-GTK 2 even has a framework called
[Callicore](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://callicore.net/)
for you to work with!

[Linkblogs](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://www.gravitonic.com/linkblog/) are turning out to be popular.
Or as Wikipedia calls it, a [Linklog](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linklog).
Considering I don't maintain bookmarks (hell, I don't even have digg account yet!); I don't think I'll maintain one, atleast in the near future.

The
[GNU Parted](http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/) developer
[mailing list](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/parted-devel/2006-December/thread.html)
had some interesting discussions in the recent past. We also moved to using
Git for version control, and it's really fun to use! Debarshi Ray, a student
from [NIT Hamirpur](http://www.nitham.ac.in/) (from what I could gather; they
even have their own
[GLUG](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://www.glug-nith.org/))
made some useful contributions and earned himself commit rights. The
project finally has enough developers to give it some momentum and all focus
is on 2.0; codenamed "Edge". I managed to get
[Trac](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://trac.edgewall.org/)
up and running on
[Alioth](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://alioth.debian.org/)
so that we could have a
[Wiki](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://parted.alioth.debian.org/),
and it was simply hell. I'm still waiting for the Alioth admins to come and revoke my shell account!

And now, for the eternal question. Is Flash evil? So it's not an open
standard and all, but I was very impressed with what
[Flex](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/) can do.
As a web developer I think it's a really promising platform for you to be
building your web applications in. (Students: Have a look at Adobe India's
[developer olympiad](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://www.adobeindia.com/ado/index.html) if you're interested in Flex).
If you're a FOSS fanatic, have a look at
[OpenLaszlo](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://www.openlaszlo.org/);
it's pretty amazing too. Especially the fact that they're working on a pure
Javascript output in addition to traditional flash under "Project Legals".

[Stuart Herbert](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://www.stuartherbert.com/),
my mentor during this years Summer of Code; announced his resignation to the
Gentoo Council on 29th November. It was sad to see him go; but ah well. My new
mentor for the Gentoo recruitment process is spb (also known as Stephen
Bennett). It's nice to work with him, and I've made it past the
[ebuild quiz](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/quiz/ebuild-quiz.txt). Got to get cracking on the
[end quiz](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/devrel/quiz/end-quiz.txt), which isn't as easy as the first one!

I'm right now in the beautiful campus of
[IIT Kanpur](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://www.iitk.ac.in/).
I've come here to attend a 3-day workshop on algorithms for data
streams; and I must say that 2 days into the workshop, I've already picked
up so much. I'm lucky to be amongst the Crème de la Crème of the data
streams scenario, and it's been an amazing experience so far. I leave
tomorrow, and shudder to think of the 40 hour train journey from New Delhi
to Bangalore which I have to spend all alone!

Anyway, if you're looking for something really funny to read
(FOSS enthusiasts only!), you have to check out
[this](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070116144738/http://geekz.co.uk/lovesraymond/)
webcomic. It's a must read!

I guess that's it for now. So until next time, keep smiling!
