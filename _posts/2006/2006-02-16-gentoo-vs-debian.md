Ah, the big question. I had a fierce debate with a friend over this one. I'm
+1 for Gentoo but that's a biased vote.

It's quite simple really. The choice depends on who you are and what you
want. Me being a developer and a linux enthusiast found the Gentoo
installation in itself a very enlightening experience, which is nothing short
of nightmare for a person who wants to switch from windows. Sure, it took 3
days, but I sure learned a lot.

Of course, saying that Debian is linux not suited for developers is
stupidity, it is after all one of the most preferred and popular distros out
there which has managed to capture both the hardcore dev crowd as well as the
n00bs. But I found it quite silly that I had to "apt-get install" to get
"make" or "autoconf". Ubuntu was even sadder. Not even a kernel source!

The point is not that you can't do something in Debian, the point is that
Gentoo forces you to do it. The installation is in itself a "Linux Tutorial",
you learn the nitty-gritty of kernel configuration, learn about gcc flags you
never thought existed, learn about configuring your obscure graphics card to
work with X. Truly eye-opening. And this is the advantage people who
installed and work with Gentoo have over those you pointed-and-clicked their
way through Debian, Ubuntu and RedHat: Complete control and Knowledge of your
PC, apart from the happiness; "YES! It Works!". So what if I couldn't sleep
for 3 days?!
