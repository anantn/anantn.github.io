Hmm, I had expected the Summer to be quite interesting, but I am overwhelmed
with the amount of excitement and work that it brought along. I haven't had
time to post on this blog for quite some time now, so this post is one
mega-chunk that covers everything I've been doing in the past few weeks.

Well, my first aircraft flight was quite enjoyable. Despite what I had
thought, my ears didn't ring and I didn't feel very uncomfortable during
take-off or landing. A great experience overall, and I'm happy that I am now
officially one of those people who have been in an international flight. The
Singapore [Changi Airport](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://www.changiairport.com.sg/changi/en/index.html)
was a pleasant change from the still-under-construction-makeshift-so-called-airport of Bangalore! I spent
some time soaking in the ambiance and excellent atmosphere over there. They
were also offering free internet for the passengers at the airport, which I
resisted against temptation.

The first thing on my mind after reaching Singapore was to find out what the
results of the Summer of Code were. Fortunately (for me!) Google had
postponed the results by a few hours, and I didn't miss the party. An hour
after hanging around in #summer-discuss, however, I received an email from
[Gentoo](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://www.gentoo.org/)
informing me that I had been selected. I was damn excited but a little
cautious, Google still had the final say as to who was in and who was not. A
little while later, the kind mentors from Ubuntu and Subversion also let me
know that I was in. Joy O Joy. Now I was sure, that I was in, through some
organisation or the other. These two acceptances were quite surprising too,
considering the fact that I had spent only an hour making each of those
proposals. More on that later though. I always had a soft spot for my Gentoo
proposal, because I had put the most effort in preparing it, so I let Google
know my 'preference'.

As if that were not enough, a representative from Google (again, nickname
withheld), let me know that was selected by 4 organisations! Indeed, one of
the moments that I will remember for life. The news was definitely beyond my
expectations, just hours earlier I was as nervous as hell as to whether I
would get even a single slot in the SoC. Minutes later, I was informed that
I was allotted the Gentoo project as per my request. All in all, a great
experience but I did miss all the excitement and suspense that the others
would have experienced when the results were actually announced.

The result announcement was quite eventful too, Google sent out around 1600
"Congratulatory" emails to those who actually weren't selected, causing a
heap of confusion. After apologies, everyone calmed down and the
authoritative result was posted on everyone's "Student Home" webapp.

The Summer-Accepted group was thrown open to all the selected students, and
then began the worst landslide of posts I have ever seen. 600 Posts were
made to the group in a matter of 10 hours. For the next few days, I was
always greeted by atleast 200 messages in the morning. The situation is much
calmer now, thankfully. Google has rounded up everyone's tax forms and is
soliciting transcripts now. Apparently they've sent out the $500 cheques, so
everyone's waiting for that along with a "surprise" that Google had promised.
Some people received Fedex notifications, and there are rumours that the
package weighs half-a-kilogram (around 1lb). I wonder what's in it...

Meanwhile, I also made some progress on other fronts, like the roadmap for
the [Banyan Tree project](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://www.globaly.org/wiki/), which was inpired by the Summer of Code.
It is intended to be a
platform like SoC, to connect developers with projects sans the $5000.
Sounds hilarious, I know, but the project is in it's infancy, and we're
working out the basic details. Join us on #banyantree (Freenode) if you're
interested, the IRC channel was kindly created by nman64 from the Fedora
project.

Then, I released 0.0.3 of
[Media_wav2mp3](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://www.gnope.org/p/Media_wav2mp3)
on
[Gnope.org](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://www.gnope.org/),
something that I've been supposed to do for quite some time now. It's
a GUI frontend to LAME for converting wav files to mp3, made in PHP-GTK 2.
Speaking of PHP-GTK 2, we're extremely close to an alpha release; the Win32
crash issue has been fixed, the PHP 5.2 compatibility issue is out of the
way, and a considerable amount of patches are in.
[GtkSourceview](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://gtksourceview.sf.net/)
and
[GtkMozembed](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://www.mozilla.org/unix/gtk-embedding.html)
have also been tested in Win32. Someone
reported a UTF8 issue in GtkScintilla and kindly provided a patch, I made a
some changes and committed it to CVS. I thinking we're more or less, all set
for the release. I'm actually waiting for the release, so that I can start
on the PHP bindings for GNOME. Hmm, which brings me to the fact that I was
later told that the 4th organisation to accept me was PHP, quite a blot from
the blue, because the comments from both
[PHP](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://www.php.net/)
and
[GNOME](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://www.gnome.org/)
on that proposal were extremely negative and dismissive. If I had known
that this proposal was the 4th one to be selected, I probably would have
chosen this over Gentoo, considering the fact that I had already completed
much of the groundwork involved here, but ah well, the Gentoo devs are just
too wonderful to work with!

I do feel kind of bad that Ubuntu and Subversion had to miss one slot each
because of me. So I offered them to do the project for them anyway, a little
later though. My work in Singapore (which involves a lot of Java, I'm
working on building a
[Struts](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://struts.apache.org/)
application that uses
[RDF](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://www.w3.org/RDF/)
data as the model, deployed on
[Tomcat](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://tomcat.apache.org/)...
truly interesting) concludes on 8th July, and I will be able to
dedicate some time to both those projects then.

BTW, I setup another
[blog](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://summerofcode.wordpress.com/)
to track my SoC progress, and updated
[KiX](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060615182246/http://www.kix.in/) to
reflect the re-ordering of projects. I also hope to write some more about my
whole SoC experience and give some good pointers to next years' SoC
aspirants as this years' program concludes. We'll see.

Well I guess that's about it, quite a lot of work ahead of me. Should be fun!

This must be the longest post I've ever written. So I guess this means I
won't be posting for quite a while now ;)
