I managed to get XGL and Compiz setup on my Macbook Pro! I used
compiz-quinnstorm actually, from the XGL-Coffee overlay. It was a relatively
simple process, and it works like a charm. Check out the
[screencast](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20061106071711/http://kix.pykix.net/xgl-compiz.mpeg)!

On other news, my trip to Delhi was really good. I had a ball at Freedel,
and my talk was largely successful. I also learnt a lot of new stuff (there
was a nice talk on GStreamer that I really liked). Some photos of the event
are coming in, we're all waiting for the whole bunch!

Oh, and my short HOWTO on Installing Linux on the Macbook Pro is coming
nicely. I just upgraded to Kernel 2.6.18 today, and everything except the
iSight camera works fine. More Later!
