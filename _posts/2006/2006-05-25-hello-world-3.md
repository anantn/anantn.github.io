The results of SoC 2006 were finally announced around midnight of 23rd May,
PDT. And it looks like I'll be working on the GuideXML editor for Gentoo.It
was a roller-coaster ride for all applicants, and as in any competition, some
made it but some didn't. Nevertheless, I am sure it was an excellent
experience for everyone involved: the students, the mentors and of course the
wonderful folks at Google's OSS office. There is a lot to be said about the
entire competition, and I plan to do so in the forthcoming months; along with
charting the progress of my project for Gentoo.I am looking forward to having
a great time with all of you, and I also hope to make this a valuable
resource for all future applicants! Once PlanetSoC is ready to accept feeds
from external blogs, I'll be adding this blog there too.
