Finally! [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/) has rolled out a beta version of its
virtualization software for the OS X as promised, and its called
[Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/beta/fusion/) (Beta). I've already
used the
[Parallels Desktop](http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/mac/) on
my Mac and it was good; but I know I can expect much more from VMWare!

Here's a list of features that VMWare claims to offer with Fusion:

* Create and run a wide variety of 32- and 64-bit x86 operating systems on
OS X without rebooting. You can simultaneously run PC applications next to
your OS X applications.

* Leverage Virtual SMP capabilities to gain additional performance
improvements. On any Mac with dual-core processors, you can assign multiple
CPUs to your virtual machine to gain additional performance for
CPU-intensive workloads.

* Access physical devices from the virtual machine: read and burn CDs and
DVDs, and use USB 2.0 devices like video cameras, iPods, printers, and disks
at full speed. Even devices that do not have drivers for OS X will work in
a virtual machine.

* Drag and drop files and folders between OS X and virtual machines to
easily share data between the two environments!

* Leverage the cross-compatibility of VMware virtual machines. VMware
virtual machines created with existing VMware products are all cross
compatible, including virtual machines created by VMware Workstation, VMware
Player, VMware Server and VMware Infrastructure 3.

* Run any of the 360 virtual appliances available from the
[Virtual Appliance Marketplace](http://vam.vmware.com/).

Downloading the 111MB DMG right now, can't wait to try Gentoo on it!
