After a lot of hacking, I finally decided to release the next mini-version
of Beacon. 0.2 has a lot of changes from the previous version; the most
significant of them being a complete architectural change. Beacon 0.1
completely relied on JavaScript for most of the XML parsing; but I switched
to PHP in this version. Hey, the server is bound to have more resources than
the client, so the application is now a whole lot faster than before!

I also finally got the DOM Tree to work. So now we have nice tree-like
display of the GuideXML document. I'll be adding DragAndDrop support to the
tree itself sometime soon, but for now you have an easy of selecting and
deleting Nodes (Chapters and Sections). Check out this screenshot:

Beacon 0.2 also using the
[Geshi](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20061119152147/http://qbnz.com/highlighter/)
syntax highlighting engine to display the XML source instead of the
earlier JavaScript engine. The XML is coloured on the server using PHP and
subsequent changes are synchronizsed via AJAX calls:

Gentoo Infra still hasn't removed the GuideXML SoC site, so you can check out
the latest Beacon version
