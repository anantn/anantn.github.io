Another one of Google's excellent ideas. Continuing from last years Summer of
Code, Google is giving a lot to the open source community by sponsoring
projects. They're inviting applications from students beginning May 1st to
participate in a variety of exciting open source projects. You're even free
to propose your own ideas!

Here's how it works. All the open source organizations have until April 31st
to apply for the post of a "Mentor Organization". All the biggies are already
part of it: GCC, GNOME, KDE, Apache Software Foundation, Python, PHP,
FreeBSD, Mono ... the list goes on and is growing by the minute. I expect
at-least 60 organizations to participate this time. On May 1st Google opens
registration to students and will accept proposals from them until May 8th.
After that the selection procedure begins. The mentor organizations will
filter out suitable candidates and inform Google about the students they'd
like to work with. Every accepted student will be assigned a mentor and the
coding starts 23rd May!

Google is offering $5000 as a stipend for every accepted project. $4500 goes
to the student and $500 to the mentoring organization. But that's only if you
successfully complete your project!

Last time, Google accepted around 400 students last year and they say the
number will be greater this time. Lots of help available from SoC 2005
veterans on how to write proposals. Check out:

I didn't know about the program last year, but I'm definitely going to apply
this time! Hopefully something to do with PHP or GNOME, I haven't quite
decided on my proposal yet. I wish everyone all the best and hope that all of
us have a great time this summer!
