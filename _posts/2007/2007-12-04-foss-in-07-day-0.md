[FOSS.IN](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://foss.in/2007/) is here. Finally.

I had been to the venue yesterday and I caught up with plenty of people, besides helping stuff the delegate kits with plenty of goodies (which I'm sure all the delegates will love). The venue looks great, the halls are awesome, and the excitement is high... I can't wait to get started.

Later I caught up with all the folks speaking at the Mozilla Project Day for Dinner at the Tandoor - I metÂ [Prasad](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://foss.in/2007/register/speakers/talkdetailspub.php?talkid=522), [Krishnakant](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://foss.in/2007/register/speakers/talkdetailspub.php?talkid=546), [Mary](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://foss.in/2007/register/speakers/talkdetailspub.php?talkid=471), [Axel](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://foss.in/2007/register/speakers/talkdetailspub.php?talkid=297), [Chris](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://foss.in/2007/register/speakers/talkdetailspub.php?talkid=326) and [Myk](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://www.melez.com/mykzilla/) - all for the first time which was really nice.

Looking forward to a great day today, and I'll keep posting events as they happen.
