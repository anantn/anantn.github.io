I couldn't help but notice that close to 70% of developers who attended
[foss.in](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://foss.in/) had
Macs with them. And half of them had even upgraded to
[Leopard](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://www.apple.com/macosx/),
giving me a few glimpses of what Apple's new operating system looked like.

I decided to upgrade to Leopard too, and got myself a copy from the iStore
on M.G. Road. It cost me Rs. 6,200 which is (suprisingly?) a little more than
the dollar-converted rate. Anyway, I decided to do a clean install after
backing up all my data - it was the perfect chance to remove all the cruft in
the system.

The installation went smoothly and the traditional multi-lingual 'Welcome'
was simply stunning. Now I began installing the applications one by one:

* [QuickSilver](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver): The first app that anyone would need. It worked with all the standard plug-ins on Leopard without any glitches. I did notice, however, that it wouldn't launch any applications that you just installed (specifically, those that you downloaded; yes, Leopard keeps track of that!). You have to manually launch the application once (you get a dialog asking you whether you really want to) before it appears in QuickSilver's catalog. Mildly irritating, but it's a one-time thing for every app.

* [Macports](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://www.macports.org/): I compiled this one, also worked out-of-the-box without any problems. All the ports I used so far work fine, although I will expect some of them to fail (which isn't a macports, but rather an upstream problem).

* [Adium](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://www.adiumx.com/)/[Colloquy](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://www.colloquy.info/): Clean install, no trouble. Imported old logs just fine.

* [iScrobbler](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://www.last.fm/group/iScrobbler): Version 1.5.2 wouldn't post to [last.fm](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://last.fm/) for some reason, version 2.0beta works great (and has a bunch of new features).

* [VMWare Fusion](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://vmware.com/mac): Works great, but it looks like you'd need some [small tweaks](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://communities.vmware.com/message/780207) to get the tools for Linux to work fine. I'm going to give Fusion a try for sometime to see how it measures up to [Parallels](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://parallels.com/en/products/desktop/) (which is what I was using earlier).

* [Poisoned](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://www.gottsilla.net/poisoned.php): This one doesn't work on Leopard. It starts up fine, and gIFT appears to start but none of the networks connect. After searching the forums for a bit, I settled for [FrostWire](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://www.frostwire.com/) which works fine.

Let's take a look at all the new features that caught my eye:

* Tabbed Terminal.app! There's no need to use [iTerm](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://iterm.sourceforge.net/) now. I did, however, have to spend a couple of hours in trying to get the key combinations to work in a sane manner. [This post](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://www.viksit.com/?q=node/261) proved to be very helpful, [DoubleCommand](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/) didn't.

* Uniform interface. Finally. I was getting sick of the varied brushed-metal/grey/what-not styled interfaces. Leopard finally has a smooth grey across all applications. No need for [UNO](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://gui.interacto.net/) anymore.

* Spaces. Eliminates the need for [VirtueDesktops](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://virtuedesktops.info/) (Notice the pattern here?). Really nifty if you run a Fusion virtual machine in full-screen on every space and assign sane keyboard shortcuts to switch.

* Stacks: Snazzy looking way of representing Downloads and Documents. You can add your own folders to 'stack'. I like the new Downloads directory, I used to create one in Tiger anyway

* dtrace. The all-encompassing debugger from OpenSolaris made easy. I haven't used it for anything useful yet but I like what I see.

* Mail 3.0. Slicker interface, and I really love the Mail Activity area which tells me exactly what Mail is upto - Mail 2.0 always left you wondering!

I haven't had a chance to look at Quick Look yet, but that should be another thing to look forward to. All-in-all a good experience so far, but was it worth the 6 grand? I'll wait and see.
