ZOMG. [Parallels](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070219120114/http://www.parallels.com/)' latest build brings along with it some nifty features. Which ultimately leads your desktop to look something like this:

No, that's not some fabricated image made in GIMP. It's for real; you can now run all the big 3 OSes side by side, just as if they've known each other for years!

Here's how you do it:

* Get yourself a powerful Intel Mac with 2Gigs of RAM (okay you may not really need this, but it's always a good idea).

* Buy a copy of the latest Parallels Desktop. More than worth it!

* Install your favourite Linux Distro and Windows on two Parallels VM's.

* Or, if you already have BootCamp and want to use the native Windows already installed, Parallels allows you to boot from that too! I already had a native Windows running on Boot Camp, and I was up and running in no time with the useful guide you can find [here](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070219120114/http://forum.parallels.com/post42129.html).

* Fire up the Linux VM, start the X server bundled with OS X. SSH to your Linux VM with X forwarding enabled, and start your favourite desktop: I chose XFCE, but Gnome/KDE will run equally well.

* Fire up your Windows VM and enable the "Coherence" mode.

* Start using Windows/OS X/Linux applications side by side, all within the comfort of your OS X desktop!

* If you're really insane create virtual machines for FreeBSD and Solaris too...

This has got to be the most coolest thing I've ever done with a computer!

(In the screenshot: Windows Start menu just below the Apple menu; XFCE-Terminal on Linux; Safari on OS X; IE on Windows; XFCE-Panel (on Linux) just to the right of the OS X Dock. Windows applications even have their own Dock items; All Linux apps will be shown as only one X app though).
