My Goa trip was simply fantabulous. Apart from the fact that Goa is a great
place for a vacation, I was accompanied by 7 of my college friends which made
the trip one that I will cherish for a long time to come.We left Bangalore by
bus on the 15th. The journey was pleasant and the view next morning was
absolutely stunning.

The bus dropped us off at the Panaji bus terminus, and we took a shuttle from
there to Vasco - where Ameya (our host) lived. After a nice lunch and a nap,
we took off to the beach closest to base camp - Bogmalo. The beach was a
quiet and clean with relatively few people around, which made it possible for
us to play a game of beach football. We returned home after jumping around in
a sea for a while.

We hired a couple of Activa’s the next day (this seems to be the norm for
transportation in Goa) and reached Old Goa in an hour or so. We visited the
really old church, which was really impressive - it also contained the
remains of St. Francis Xavier. The archaeological museum next door was fun
too, very informative about the history of Goa. We proceeded to the capital
city of Panaji next, and after booking tickets for a river cruise aboard the
Princess de Goa for the night, had lunch at the QuarterDeck.

After lunch, we visited Donapaula, a popular Jetty, which was unfortunately
under renovation or something. The view was great though, and we enjoyed a
nice little ride on the water scooter. After hanging out in Cafe Coffee Day
for a while (These places are *everywhere*, I think they’re trying to become
the Indian Starbucks) we reached the Panaji river coast to board the
Princess de Goa. These river cruises seem to be a popular attraction, they
basically consist of a few dance shows, a dance floor and an amazing view. We
got to see the (in?)famous floating casino on the way too.

My Summer of Code mentor, Matt Lawless, happened to be in Goa too, so we
scheduled lunch for the next day. We met at the Calangute post office (which
was somewhat close to Matt’s home) and proceeded to the Calangute beach after
lunch. My friends, meanwhile, reached the Baga beach, which was just next
door to the Calangute beach (the two most famous beaches in Goa). We splashed
around in the water for a while, joined by Matt, and then a second lunch!

Matt decided to leave, and we went on to try some of the water sports at the
beach. We went for a banana ride, a water scooter trip, but the one that took
the cake was the parasailing. Nothing like a gentle ride in the sky to
rejuvenate you. Flying over water with the beach behind you and the sunset in
front is an experience I can’t put in words!

The third and last day began with a long ride to south Goa, where we first
visited the Benauli beach. This beach was beautiful, the sand was different
than the others, and the most fun part was when I was buried by the others:

The rest of the day was spent at GoaKart, which was apparently a national
Karting track. Parasailing was great, but karting was really the most
exhilarating, especially because we raced and went for 4 rounds.

didn’t let me upload more than 100MB of photos at once, so I moved to [Picasa](
http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080217014208/http://picasaweb.google.com/)
Web Albums instead. I wrote a small script: [backr.py](http://proness.kix.in/misc/backr.py)
that uses James Clarke’s [flickr.py](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080217014208/http://code.google.com/p/flickrpy/)
to back up all my photos and uploaded them to Picasa Web, which allows me to
create as many albums as I want (unlike Flickr).

So, I guess that’s a few more items off my "list of things to do before I die"!
