Well, looks like it’s time for the annual ["great summer"](/2006/08/21/what-a-summer/) report!

I managed to finish my [GSoC](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070903042918/http://code.google.com/soc/) [project](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070903042918/http://code.kix.in/projects/web9) for Plan 9 from Bell Labs this year well in time, and I’m quite pleased with myself. I learned so much, and got to spend time with some of the most brilliant people in the field of computer science… it’s been so amazing that I’m at a loss for words.

I had so much fun implementing the [9P protocol](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070903042918/http://9p.cat-v.org/) in JavaScript that I almost immeditey began a native PHP implementation; right now I’m polishing it for inclusion in PEAR. And hopefully, someday, my bindings over libixp might get included as a bundled extension in the PHP distribution.

Another cool thing I managed to do this summer was [build](/2007/08/22/say-hello-to-angled-0-1/) a firefox extension. Nothing too fancy, but I’m still happy with what I managed to do. Times like this, I can’t help but bow to the IRC and Usenet overlords - couldn’t have done it without the help of those dozens of people!

After working with Plan 9 for a while, I got this crazy idea of trying to build a toy OS of my own, just for kicks. Really, looking at the source code for Plan 9 makes you believe that you don’t have to be a rockstar to build an operating system. Sure enough, after some help from the folks at [osdev](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070903042918/http://www.osdever.net/), I managed to get “Hello World!” on the Parallels virtual machine screen. I feel good.

[Freed.IN](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070903042918/http://www.freed.in/) is coming up (formerly known as [Freedel](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070903042918/http://www.freedel.in/)), and I sent in a proposal on creating synthetic file-systems with (guess what) 9P. Irrespective of whether my talk is chosen or not, I’m going to Delhi; there’s too much fun involved to even think about missing!

Oh, and, I got myself a job (tee-hee) at the [Computer Sciences Corporation](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070903042918/http://www.csc.com/). But, well, [Yahoo!](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070903042918/http://bangalore.yahoo.com/) is visiting our campus on the 4th... let’s see what the future holds for me.
