We reached a little late for Day 2, because there were no talks in particular that we had wanted to attend. After reaching the venue at around 11:00, the first thing we did was to distribute the Gentoo t-shirts so folks could wear them today (the t-shirt needs one wash before wear). Shyam (fox2mike) had brought the Gentoo banner so we set that up in the stall.

[G0SUB](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://g33k.wordpress.com/) and myself then attended pradeepto's [talk](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://foss.in/2007/register/speakers/talkdetailspub.php?talkid=550) on setting up a KDE development environment. This was followed by an amazing demonstration of [dtrace](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace/) by the one and only [GMan](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://blogs.gnome.org/gman/) (Glynn Foster from Sun/GNOME). dtrace is really powerful, although I keep hearing about it, yesterday was the first time I actually understood how useful it is.

After lunch, I attended [Debarshi's](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://debarshiray.multiply.com/) talk on [Opyum](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071222125820/http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DebarshiRay/Opyum), his summer of code project for this year. Also got to meet a bunch of other SoCers and we've all planned a SoC BoF along with a few mentors who are also present at the event.

Then we got busy distributing invites for the Mozilla party, and hung out with the Mozilla gang until it was time to leave. The party was at Opus which was a nice place with good (loud) music :). The karaoke was a big hit. After meeting a lot of people and having some good discussion, I decided to call it a day (I had two talks to prepare for!).

Day 3 begins in a few hours - both my talks are today and we're going to kick off the Gentoo stall, so I'm really excited. See you tomorrow with another update!
