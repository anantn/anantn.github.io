Okay, so I got together a decent client for all of you to test out the
repodoc web service. It's pretty basic, just about 35 lines of code, uses
the
[cURL](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20061119152147/http://www.php.net/curl)
and
[XSL](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20061119152147/http://www.php.net/xsl)
extensions of PHP5, and displays a tabulated page that shows how tha
validation went. I haven't concentrated too much on the eye-candy yet, I'm
waiting until I decide on a nice theme for the editor itself.

Check out the
[client](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20061119152147/http://www.kix.in/soc/repodoc/client.phps),
the
[upload form](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20061119152147/http://www.kix.in/soc/repodoc/upload.html), and a sample
[result file](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20061119152147/http://www.kix.in/soc/repodoc/sample-result.html).

Meanwhile, I'm steadily moving on the ebuild, it should be done now that the
client is ready. I'm also going through
"[AJAX Patterns and Best Practices](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20061119152147/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590596161/102-2053402-7158531?v=glance&n=283155)"
to see which pattern applies to the editor the best. Needless to say, if any
of you have ideas, comments, suggestions or cristicisms, be sure to send them
my way.
