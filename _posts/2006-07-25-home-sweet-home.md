Okay, a quick post to make up for the long gap. I just didn't have time to
update the blog, there's too much going on!

Well, the project at NUS was largely successful, we now have a working and
generic [Struts](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://struts.apache.org/)
application that reads RDF files and instantly makes them searchable.
Needless to say, I learnt a lot, but I was also kind of frustrated with the
Java Web Application structure. Especially since we now have more modern
frameworks like
[Zope](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://www.zope.org/),
[Django](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://www.djangoproj
ect.com/) and
[TurboGears](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://www.turbogears.org/). Personally, Java just doesn't suit me! Check out this
[screencast](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://oodt.jpl.nasa.gov/better-web-app.mov) from Sean Kelly at [JPL, NASA](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), in which he
compares J2EE, Ruby on Rails, TurboGears, Zope/Plone and
Django. The file is 380MB and lasts about half-an-hour, but is totally worth
watching!

Well, back at home, my awesome new Macbook Pro was awaiting me! I was raring to
[install](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://www.mactel-linux.org/)
Gentoo Linux on it, and yeah, it took me about a day to get that
sorted out. My Sound still doesn't work, and there's an experimental
[iSight driver](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://blogs.gnome.org/view/rbultje)
that I haven't tried yet. Once I get a fully-functional Linux
on the beast, I'll post a nice integrated HOWTO. I'm simply amazed at how
awesome the community is, we have a lot of people working on trying to get
everything to run just fine. Well, I wish them all the best, because if we
have everything in order, I'm going to remove Mac OS X! ;)

Speaking of which, my first experience with the new operating system was
amazing. I felt quite at home with the BASH terminal, and the overall
look-and-feel were great! I migrated from Thunderbird to Apple Mail just to
test it out, and yeah Apple Mail was good. I tried out
[Adium](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://www.adiumx.com/)
for my instant messaging needs, another awesome application, which
unfortunately doesn't have IRC support. So I got X-Chat Aqua, which, as the
name implies is the aquafied version of X-Chat. More on my Mac OS X
adventures later thoughâ€¦

My birthday was a lot of fun, I finally got my Driving License; although the
next day I was down with the Fever! On the bright side, the totally amazing
[Christian](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://www.cweiske.de/),
decided to surpise me by gifting [1984](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://www.online-literature.com/orwell/1984/), a book that
I really wanted, to me on my birthday. Heh, my first package from a foriegn
country, w00t! So, that's one item off my wishlist.

I also made a trip to Chennai, where I finally saw the totally cool
[NRCFOSS](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://www.au-kbc.org/nrcf/index.htm)
(National Resource Centre for Free and Open Source Software) in-person. It's a
real-nice place, nested in MIT, Chrompet, just a 2 minutes walk from the
Chrompet station. They had a workshop on translation, and we had a good time
translating Django into Tamil using
[KBabel](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://kbabel.kde.org/).
I also volunteered to be a mentor for their
[Fellowship](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://nrcfosshelpline.in/web/full/4/AN/) Program,
and I am looking forward to it!

The [SoC project](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://summerofcode.wordpress.com/)
has picked up pace and I made significant progress on the
editor, I just hope I can wrap it up in time! I'm going to be spending the
next two days in the train, yeah, my 5th semester starts on 24th. On other
news, we finally have an Alpha release for [PHP-GTK 2](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://gtk.php.net/)!
Uh, it was actually called Zeta in the beginning (everyone was bored of alpha),
but apparently the
[PEAR](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://pear.php.net/)
installer doesn't recognize anything other than alpha or beta. Heh, so we
had to switch back to convention. Now that Alpha is out, I have to start
working on the PHP-Gnome bindings. Oh, and my article on PHP-GTK 2 is
scheduled to appear in
[php|arch](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060905225343/http://www.phparch.com/)
this month, so watch out!

Well, I guess that wraps up everything, surely I've missed some details, ah
well. I hope that I am able to make some arrangements for internet access
once I reach college, we'll see.
