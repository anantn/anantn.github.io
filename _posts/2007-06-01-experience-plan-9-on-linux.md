[Plan9](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070607083037/http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/) is an operating system that is designed to make up for all the mistakes that UNIX made. And it’s quite different from any of the current UNIX clones, be it any of the BSDs or Linux. To ease the migration, there’s a project called [Plan9Port](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070607083037/http://swtch.com/plan9/); which is essentially a port of several Plan9 utilities to the POSIX platform.

I recently made an [ebuild](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070607083037/http://packages.gentoo.org/packages/?category=dev-util;name=plan9port) for  Plan9Port, also called Plan from User Space. Just ‘emerge plan9port’ and spread the Plan9 love!

Speaking of which, my Summer of Code project for Plan9 is progressing well. More details on my [SoC blog](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070607083037/http://summerofcode.wordpress.com/), or the [aggregator at KiX](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070607083037/http://www.kix.in/planet/).
