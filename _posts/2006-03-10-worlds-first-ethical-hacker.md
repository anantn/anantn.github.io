I was amused by the recent buzz in my college about Ankit Fadia  coming on
Friday to deliver a talk on "Ethical Hacking". I saw posters  all over
college claiming that he was the "World's first Ethical  Hacker", which is a
joke at best. Ethical hacking was an art known to  many much before he gained
prominence in the field of computer security.  Of course, I have nothing
against him; he is defintely an exceptional  young achiever (Yep, I think
he's just 19 years old now!), with his 5  books on computer security selling
like hot cakes both in India and  abroad.

I think all that hype is because of the corporate that is financing  his
visit here: Reliance Infocomm. They recently launched a training  program at
all their Webworld outlets across the nation: "Ankit Fadia  Certified Ethical
Hacker", which is why he is coming to India in the  first place. The launch
of such a program is also amusing to many, after  all we don't see
educational programs that are named after a person  everyday. I can just
imagine how unprofessional "Bill Gates Certified  Software Engineer" would
sound. I guess this sort of stuff happens only  in India!

What's more, rumours are that the great Director of our college has  banned
the event from taking place. I guess it was the word "hacking"  that drove
him to think that Ankit was going to teach us "how to hack"!  Talk about
being old-fashioned. (See: [Another Day at an Indian College](/2006/02/22/another-day-at-and-indian-college/))

I just can't wipe the smile off my face!
