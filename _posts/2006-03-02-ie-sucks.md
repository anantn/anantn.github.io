I somehow happened to visit my own website in Internet Explorer for the first
time (I think it was from one of the PC's in the labs of our college) and was
shocked to see how it looked! All my pages were XHTML1.1 validated, but the
site looked nothing short of atrocious on IE.

The png images were not transparent, and not a single padding CSS rule was
obeyed. I thought I must do something about this, and hence blocked all IE
users from visiting the website at all! This was inspired by [Christian
Weiske](http://www.cweiske.de/), his site does the same too. Just 4 lines of
PHP, and I was done.

I do hope that this makes a difference, I would be very happy even if just
one person decides to switch to a better browser because they couldn't view
mine or Christian's site!
