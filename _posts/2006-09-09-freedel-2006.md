I'll be giving a talk on "Building web applications using Javascript" on
September 16th at
[Freedel](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20061106071711/http://www.freedel.in/).
It's my first talk, so I'm both nervous and excited! Anyway, if you
happen to be anywhere near the NCR on 16th and 17th, do drop in. I'll be
focussing on the MochiKit and Dojo toolkits, both of which were extensively
used to make Beacon, the GuideXML editor. I'll also be offering some insight
into how Beacon was built at the presentation.
