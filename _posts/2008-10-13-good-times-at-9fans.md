The 9fans list has produced TWO fortune-worthy quotes this weekend, a rather rare occurrence:

> If you cannot read this, reply. Otherwise, disregard. -[Pietro Gagliardi](http://9fans.net/archive/2008/10/140)

> Come _on_. I'm not that subtle a "baiter," or... am I? -[Eris Discordia](http://9fans.net/archive/2008/10/153)

> you're a master baiter. -[Skip Tavakkolian](http://9fans.net/archive/2008/10/154)

I must say the quality of traffic on the list has been deteriorating even over the relatively small amount of time I've been subscribed to it.
