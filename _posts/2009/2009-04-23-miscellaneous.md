I've been keeping quite busy the last few months, thanks to the extremely time-consuming but fun masters program I'm enrolled in. Sure, I've also ensured that I enjoy Europe while I'm at it, but that makes my blog posts much less frequent and further apart. Between "[micro-blogging](http://twitter.com/anantn)" and frequent facebook updates, there is much less time for blogging these days.

It's spring now and we can all stop complaining about the Dutch weather. The temperature stays around a pleasant 10 to 15 degrees. One of the more recent trips I made to take advantage of the season was to [Keukenhof](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090619010317/http://www.keukenhof.com/), the famous flower garden. Check out selected pictures [here](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090619010317/http://www.flickr.com/photos/an_ant/sets/72157617123665821/).

As I try to wrap up some of my pending assignments (did I mention they were fun?), I'm also preparing for travel in the next 2 weeks. First stop, Mountain View, for an "All Hands" session at Mozilla. Next, I head out to Italy, starting with Milan, and then heading on to Venice, Rome, the Vatican and Pisa. Looking forward to the trip!

In other news, the GSoC results were [announced](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090619010317/http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/04/announcing-accepted-students-for-google.html) recently, and I'm continuing my mentoring role from last year with [two](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090619010317/http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/gentoo/t124022356100) [students](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090619010317/http://socghop.appspot.com/student_project/show/google/gsoc2009/plan9/t124024224877). Even though [Glendix](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090619010317/http://glendix.org/) didn't make it to the organisations list, we got several good proposals via Plan 9 and Gentoo, which was certainly very encouraging. This time, India has the second largest number of student selections (101!) - simply marvelous. This will be my 4th Summer of Code, and I'm very happy to be involved with the program for this long.

Cheerio!
