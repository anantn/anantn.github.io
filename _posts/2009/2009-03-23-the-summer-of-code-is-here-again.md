It's that time of the year. Google is, yet again, sponsoring students to write some awesome open source code this summer. If you're a student, and you'd like to make some money contributing to some of the most well known and exciting open source software projects out there, you'd be missing out on a lot by not [applying](http://socghop.appspot.com/).

If you're wondering about what the best way to get started is, check out this great [advice](http://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code/wiki/AdviceforStudents) page. All projects have also been tagged by programming language and field in this [delicious profile](http://delicious.com/gsoc2009). You can also search for ideas [here](http://tinyurl.com/gsocideas).

I'm going to be mentoring for [Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode09), [Glendix](http://www.glendix.org/gsoc/) (under the [Plan 9](http://gsoc.cat-v.org/ideas/) Umbrella) and [Gentoo](http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/2009_Summer_Of_Code_Ideas) this year. Get in touch if you're interested in any of those ideas :)

The window for applications opens in a few hours. Good luck everyone!
