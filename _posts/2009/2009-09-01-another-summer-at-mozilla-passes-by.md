My last day at Mozilla this summer was last Thursday. I didn't take a lot of pictures this summer, because, you know, I [took a lot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/an_ant/collections/72157606477971633/) last time around. Also, this strategy turned out pretty well because now there are more pictures of me floating around on the tubes! After a longish trans-atlantic flight, I'm back in Amsterdam now resuming work on my Master's (because [hacking on Minix](http://minix3tips.blogspot.com/) is awesome).

No other internship has been ever so satisfying: over the summer, I worked on a wide range of mini-projects which allowed me to exercise skills ranging from systems to application level programming. I even did a bit of work in the mobile space (turns out programming in limited memory and processing speed is a *lot* different).

One such project that I'm especially excited about is support for [video recording](http://hg.mozilla.org/labs/jetpack/file/tip/components/experimental/video) in the browser. Yes, there is even a canvas-based live preview of your webcam feed, in addition to Ogg/Theora encoding support! Combined with the audio recording support I wrote sometime ago, some really cool applications are now possible. Skype-like dialer in the browser? Why not?! (*hint* anyone is free to send in a patch for multiplexing the audio and video, they're currently two separate Vorbis and Theora streams *hint*).

We also had 3 major releases for Weave during the summer: 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6. The last one was especially big, given the completely new, HTML based UI (big kudos to [thunder](http://twitter.com/thunder/) for pulling it off!) and a bunch of other performance fixes. Also, the web UI I wrote last year underwent so many great changes by the wonderful folks at [Glaxstar](http://www.glaxstar.com/). Now we're putting up a [community design challenge](http://design-challenge.mozilla.com/fall09/) to revamp the UI so we can ship the thing! (*hint* if you're good at UI design you should participate in the challenge *hint*).

There's so many more cool things I worked on that I'd like to talk about, but perhaps they deserve a separate blog post. Soon... (I keep promising myself that I should blog more often, it never works).

To add the already good times, my two students in the Summer of Code this year passed with flying colors. Yay!
