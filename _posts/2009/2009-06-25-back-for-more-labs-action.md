It's been 3 weeks since I started my (second) summer internship at Mozilla Labs, and needless to say it's been a blast! I'm continuing my work on Weave, besides helping out with the [gamut of experiments](http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/) that are currently running at the Labs. Weave is going to see some major strides forward in the near future, as we now have our very own Product Manager (Welcome, [Ragavan](http://twitter.com/ragavan)!) in addition to the awesome [Mike Connor](http://steelgryphon.com/blog/) joining the team :)

Within the first week of my arrival here, Mozilla made the move to the new office, which is possibly the sweetest workplace I've ever seen in my life. Check out selected pictures [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/deb-richardson/sets/72157619365961813/).

There's been the usual slew of intern activities, including, but not limited to: Canoeing, Movie nights, Birthday celebrations, [Music discovery](http://thesixtyone.com/), and even a few dungeon runs on WoW ;)

Look for more posts on labsy stuff in the near future.
