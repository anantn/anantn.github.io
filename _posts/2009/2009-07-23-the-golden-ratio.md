Today we had the pleasure of having [Brendan Eich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich) hosting a brown bag for all us interns, and he started out his talk with slides on the [Golden Ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio).

I did have a vague idea of what the ratio was - but today I found out a lot more about it - like how it occurs in almost every natural creation or phenomenon. The mysteriousness of the universe is very humbling. Perhaps if we used a different number system that was based on 1.6180339887 instead of 10, everything would make perfect sense...

Anyway, one thing it definitely explains is my love for 16:9 screens as opposed to the old 4:3 ones!
