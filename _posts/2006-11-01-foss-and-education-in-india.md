So, its been an exciting week. It seems like we really may be able to
introduce a department elective on FOSS here in our college! We're all set
to get this in motion, and we've also invited people from
[NRCFOSS](http://www.nrcfoss.org.in/) and [ilugd](http://linux-delhi.org/)
to come over and talk to the students and faculty on what FOSS is all
about, and why its worth having such a course in the curriculum.

I really hope this plan is successful; if it does, it definitely means a
giant leap in the technical education scenario in India. Although some
colleges under the Anna University already offer two electives designed by
the NRCFOSS as part of the curriclum, none of the "biggies" of Anna
University - CEG or MIT chose to offer it.

Our department already offers a rich set of electives, ranging from Neural
networks to Robotics, which makes it difficult to offer two electives only
on FOSS. It's much easier for us to just offer a single crash-course type of
elective on FOSS, and for this purpose, I modified the
[two-course syllabus](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20061106071711/http://nrcfosshelpline.in/code/wiki/FossElectivesSyllabus)
created by the NRCFOSS a bit to get one tailor-made for our college. Check it
out [here](http://proness.kix.in/itr/foss-elective.pdf),
I'd love to hear some feedback on it.

Heh, if the course is accepted at the Senate meeting to be held in December;
we may actually beat the IIT's at offering this course. Mwhahaha! ;)
