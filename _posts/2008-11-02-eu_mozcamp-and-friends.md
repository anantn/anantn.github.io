I've been doing a _lot_ of traveling in the past few weeks, starting with the really exciting "Northside Weekend" at the Dutch towns of Tolbert and Groningen. Copious amounts of embarrassing pictures were generated on Facebook: I wouldn't expect any less from a group of 60 students hanging out over the weekend ;)

Allowing for just enough time to recover, I had to write my final exam for the Parallel Programming course. Having courses compressed into such short time periods can be both and good and bad, I guess I will decide for myself when the results come in!

I left almost immediately after the exam to catch a flight to Barcelona, for [EU MozCamp 2008](https://wiki.mozilla.org/EU_MozCamp_2008). There was a Labs Session at the Facultat d'inform√†tica de Barcelona the next day, part of Dan and Aza's Europe tour. I managed to reach just before the session ended, thanks to me getting lost and then someone pointing me to a different place in the opposite direction. [thunder](http://blog.sandmill.org/), [aza](http://www.azarask.in/blog/) and myself then traversed the excellent Metro system in the city, to catch up with [cbeard](http://cbeard.typepad.com/) for lunch. I had my first experience with Tapas, and it wasn't bad at all - the fact that thunder knows spanish helped a lot. [mconnor](http://steelgryphon.com/blog/) joined us shortly after. A fabulous dinner later, we were all set for the first day of MozCamp :)

Most Mozilla events are all about meeting new people and catching up with people you knew already. I made the most of it, it was nice to see faces back from Mountain View, and some new ones. Aza was scheduled for a Labs keynote on the first day, which was pretty good. Unfortunately, he seemed to have contracted food poisoning, or maybe just general exhaustion and insomnia from the whole Labs Europe tour; so they postponed the session on Ubiquity to the next day. [David Ascher](http://ascher.ca/blog/)'s talk was fantastic with some really cool demos, Thunderbird 3 is going to be prodigious! We had a session on Weave that evening, which also went off reasonably well, though the audience seemed more focused on the legal and privacy aspects of the project. Not a bad thing, just not interesting to me - I'd rather think and talk about technical challenges ;)

I had the wonderful opportunity to have dinner with [Mark Surman](http://commonspace.wordpress.com/), Executive Director of the Mozilla Foundation. I also met up with Suneel who had just recently joined Mozilla at Mountain View, and we all had a great time! mconnor had to stay awake a little later than the rest of us, to prepare for his talk the next day.

Highlights of Day 2 were mconnor's talk, 2010 goals discussion and the session on Ubiquity. I also had a brief discussion with Dan on some of my plans for Weave 0.3, it's going to be awesome! Labs team did a little sightseeing that night, and then caught up with [John Lilly](http://john.jubjubs.net/), accompanied by his wife, for dinner. A perfect end to an excellent weekend.

Thanks Mozilla Europe, and Barcelona!
