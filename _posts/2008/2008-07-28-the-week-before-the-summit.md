Time for a quick update on what I've been upto this week...

Let's start with the Intern BBQ - I guess the highlight of the event was [Schrep](http://blog.mozilla.com/schrep/) _almost_ being thrown into the pool, I think David [sums it up](http://www.bailopan.net/blog/?p=82) quite nicely. I left the same night for L.A. - the primary item on my agenda was to attend [Russell Peters](http://www.russellpeters.com/) and Friends at the [Grove of Anaheim](http://www.thegroveofanaheim.com/). The show was great, he didn't repeat any of his old jokes and we had 3 other _comics_ (as Russell called them) - all of them kept us laughing for over 2 hours.

I spent all of Sunday at Universal Studios, Hollywood - which was also great fun. The studio tour, 'Water World' and 'Jurassic Park' attractions were especially worth it. I caught a Greyhound back to San Jose and headed straight to work.

Week 10 was spent in finishing up the OAuth implementation for Weave - both server-side and client-side. I also wrote a PHP library to access a user's Bookmarks and open Tabs via OAuth. We had a small demo at the third edition of [Labs Night](http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/07/monthly-labs-meetup-july-2008/) (which was held on Thursday, Jono gives a more [detailed account](http://jonoscript.wordpress.com/2008/07/25/our-presentation-at-labs-night/)). As we get closer to unrolling both the Weave web client and the OAuth API, I'm looking to forward to some great mashups from third party developers :-)

Maria, Rob, Paul and I spent saturday touring the vineyards and hills of Santa Cruz...

Now, we have a plane to catch in about 7 hours for what is poised to be a climax of gargantuan proportions for my summer. Keep track of what's going on at Whistler at [Summitr](http://summit.mozilla.org/). Needless to say, I'm super-excited!
