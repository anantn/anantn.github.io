Firefox is aiming to set a record in the [Guinness book of World Records](http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/) for the largest number of software downloads in a 24 hour period immediately after Firefox 3 is launched (which should be in June if all goes well).

Be a part of history by pledging to download Firefox 3 when it is released on the [Firefox World Record](http://spreadfirefox.com/worldrecord/) page! You can also plan your local Download Fests at [Mozilla Party Central](http://mozillaparty.com/). How cool is that!
