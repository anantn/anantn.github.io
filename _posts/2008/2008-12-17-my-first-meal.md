Today, after roaming the earth for 21 years depending on someone else to cook my food for me, I made a giant leap: I cooked my own meal. Right from buying groceries to cleaning up the dishes afterward.

Here's a picture of the modest beginning:

It looks a lot more delicious than it really was: just boiled vegetables with garlic bread - dressed with salt, pepper and a dollop of butter - rather bland for an Indian tongue. But, oh well, it's a start ;)
