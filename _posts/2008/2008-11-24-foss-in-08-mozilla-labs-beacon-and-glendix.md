[FOSS.IN 2008](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081211013419/http://foss.in/2008/) begins tomorrow!

It's going to be really interesting to see how the departure from the '07 formula works out.

I'll be conducting a [Workout](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081211013419/http://workouts.foss.in/2008/index.php/Beacon:_The_WYSIWYG_XML_Editor) on [Beacon](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081211013419/http://beacon.kix.in/), the web-based GuideXML editor on [Day 4 (Friday)](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081211013419/http://foss.in/2008/register/speakers/talkdetailspub.php?talkid=620).  If you're interested in contributing to a next generation AJAX powered  web application and are familiar with Javascript with a bit of PHP or  Python, I highly recommend dropping in.

There will also be a talk on [Innovation and Mozilla Labs](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081211013419/http://foss.in/2008/register/speakers/talkdetailspub.php?talkid=583) on Day 5 (Saturday), where we'll take Weave as a case-study to see how  ideas are incubated at the Labs. I'll be talking about how you can  contribute to the [various initatives](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081211013419/http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/) at Mozilla Labs. Or maybe you're just curious about the future of the  web and how you can help shape it. In any case, you want to be there  (*hint* there will be goodies *hint*)!

Two [Glendix](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081211013419/http://glendix.org/) hackers, myself and Shantanu are also going to be at the event, and there's a [whole day ](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081211013419/http://foss.in/news/linux-kernel-hackers-gathering.html)dedicated  to Linux kernel hacking. I'm planning a lightning talk on Glendix  during the gathering,Â  and hopefully we can gather enough interest to  get some work done on some of the project's [priorities](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20081211013419/http://glendix.org/wiki/doku.php?id=workout).

See you at India's largest FOSS event!
