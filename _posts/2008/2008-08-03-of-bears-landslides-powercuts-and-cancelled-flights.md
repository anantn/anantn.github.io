Bear with me for this long post (no pun intended) describing the awesome [Mozilla Summit](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080906012248/http://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2008) at [Whistler](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080906012248/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/canada/whistler/). The short version is that it was [supercalifragilisticexpialidoceous](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080906012248/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercalifragilisticexpialidoceous). Ok, that's a nonsense word but there's no way I can put the experience in just one word.

**Monday**
All the interns got up fairly early to catch a shuttle to SFO, and we  arrived in Whistler after a pleasant 3 hour flight and 2 hour bus ride  from YVR. The scenery was fantastic all along the way, and the hotel was  overwhelmingly comfortable. Nothing much happened except meeting some  familiar as well as new people at dinner.

**Tuesday**
First day of the summit started off with keynotes by John Lilly and Mitchell Baker. Mitchell's [analogy](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080906012248/http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/07/29/the-mozilla-tree/) of what she thought of Mozilla was especially intriguing. A great way  to kick-off the sessions that were to follow over the next few days. The  [UX talk](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080906012248/http://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2008/Sessions/Proposals/History_%26_Future:_Imagining_the_Web_Browser_of_2015) on the history and future of browsers was especially a good one. Highlight of the day was Gary [spotting bears](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080906012248/http://www.rumblingedge.com/2008/07/29/bear-with-me-while-you-sleep-at-whistler/). Apparently, there were a few that were brave enough to jump into the room balconies too.

**Wednesday**
I spent most of the early part of the day in the Emerald room, attending  sessions on Mozilla's Technology roadmap, Fennec and the Labs concept  series. I ended the round of session-attending with Myk's talk on [Snowl](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080906012248/http://www.melez.com/mykzilla/2008/07/snowl-experiment-with-messaging-in.html), which is another cool labs project (well, all labs projects are cool!).

The big news of the day was the [rockslide](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080906012248/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2008/07/30/bc-highway-rockslide-whistler.html) on the road connecting Vancouver with Whistler. ~350 at the summit  suddenly had to change travel plans to accomodate for this… um… natural  disaster. The contingency plan involved 8-hour long bus rides on a  longer, more _scenic_ route or float planes.

The labs team spent wednesday night hacking at Chris' room, in  preparation for our presentations the next day. Prior experience led us  to believe that relying on the WiFi network in the hotel was probably  not a wise idea for our demos, so I setup a local weave sever with a few  demo accounts and changed the bookmark sharing code to not depend on  XMPP to notify the receving user of the share. It was 3 am by the time I  got to sleep so I responsibly set an alarm because the weave talk was  the first one on the next day.

**Thursday**
Except the alarm didn't go off, and I woke up 45 minutes _after_ the scheduled time for the session. My first reaction was along the lines of _oops, I screwed up_.  But as I became fully awake I realized there was no power in the entire  hotel and breathed a sigh of relief because all the morning sessions  were postponed. So the story was that a laundry truck ran into a  transformer and it would take a few hours for power to be restored.

The Labs sessions were moved to a conference room run by our friendly  neighbors (The Hilton), and we started off shortly after lunch. The  Labs sessions on [Weave](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080906012248/http://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Weave) and [Ubiquity](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080906012248/http://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity) went off really well and I think they created a lot of buzz. Especially with ubiquity, some of the demos were mind-blowing!

Though I really wanted to attend the session on HG, I decided to take  a nap instead and prepare myself for the grand dinner atop [Whistler-Blackcomb](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080906012248/http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/index.htm) (which are, incidentally, codenames for Windows editions). The dinner  was a fine end to a fine summit, and I was especially excited to  experience snowfall for the first time in my life.

My plan to get back home was to catch a Floatplane with the rest of  Labs the next morning, in time for the YVR-SFO flight at 3 pm.

**Friday**
But NO. All the floatplanes had been cancelled due to fog and low tides,  so Dan & Chris put me up on the last bus out of Whistler at 11 am,  and kindly provided a goodie bag full of food and coffee for my 8 hour  bus ride.

The ride itself was not bad at all, the scenery on the way was well worth it. As we approached Vancouver (around 6:30 pm), [Melissa Shapiro](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080906012248/http://icouldntfindanypaper.blogspot.com/) found me on the bus and informed me that she would try to catch the  8:15 pm flight to SFO (which was the last one out of YVR) and  recommended I do the same. The bus didn't go to the airport, but to the  Sheraton at Wall centre instead, so Melissa and I took a cab and rushed  to the airport.

We managed to get standby tickets on the plane, and went through US  immigration, customs and security check (where I was "selected for  random screening"). We did make it to the gate on time, but not on the  plane. Technically, I had to re-enter Canada through immigration, but I  had a single-entry VISA. Thankfully, Melissa was there to vouch for me,  so I was able to make it back in.

Chris had rooms for us at the Sheraton and we headed back. After a  great dinner with Bret, Brad, Melissa, Chris and Dan, I tucked in for  the night watching Vancouver's great skyline.

**Saturday**
Quite an uneventful day, considering the last week, because everything  went as planned. All of us had confirmed tickets on the 11 am flight to  SFO.

Melissa, Chris and I stopped for a while at Stanley Park on our way  to the Aiport, while Dan had to leave early because he had to pick up  his bag and passport (which he left at the party on Thursday, there's  another whole story!)

**Phew**
Well, I'm back in Mountain View now; and only have a week more to go.  I'm really going to miss everyone, and the summit just made it a whole  lot harder for me to say goodbye. But as Chris Hoffman had said in a  brown-bag sometime ago: _This is Hotel Mozilla - you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave!_

Just want to convey a big Thank You to everyone at Mozilla;  especially Dan Portillo, Tiffney Mortensen, John Lilly, Julie Deroche,  Melissa Shapiro, Maria Emerson, and most of all, Chris Beard, for making my experience at the summit an experience of a lifetime!
