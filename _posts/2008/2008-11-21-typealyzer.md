Just dicovered [Typealyzer](http://www.typealyzer.com/) [via Tejas](http://tejasd.livejournal.com/29512.html). This post makes a nice successor to the previous one: Typealyzer [analyzes](http://www.typealyzer.com/en/about) a blog and tries to predict your Myers-Briggs type based on it. My result was ESTP (The Doer) as opposed to INTP (The Thinker) returned by other traditional personality tests (such as 41 Questions, covered in the previous post).

It's interesting to note that while I'm an "introvert" in real-life, my blog posts are generally "extrovert" in nature. Though I wonder what an introvert blog looks like - most people maintain a blog because they want to express themselves, no? Also, I'm apparently more Sensing than iNtuitive in my writing, as opposed to real life. The other two characteristics: Thinking and Perception remain the same.
