Mozilla is making great strides towards making impacting innovations built on the open web. If you haven't already heard, the always awesome [Chris Beard](http://cbeard.typepad.com/) was appointed as Mozilla's [Chief Innovation Officer](http://john.jubjubs.net/2008/10/13/mozilla-chief-innovation-officer-chris-beard/). He'll be heading the newly formed [Developer Tools Lab](http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/10/developer-tools-and-the-open-web/) which was formed after the co-founders of [Ajaxian](http://ajaxian.com/archives/ajaxians-join-mozilla-creating-developer-tools), [Ben](http://galbraiths.org/blog/) and [Dion](http://almaer.com/blog/), were hired by Mozilla. That's in addition to his existing responsibilities with Mozilla Labs and Evangelism.

I feel extremely privileged to be working with a group of such brilliant people.

With projects like Geode, Ubiquity, Weave, and Snowl already on the table; I simply can't hold my excitement in anticipation of the great things that are to come out from Mozilla in the near future!
