The 18th of May consisted of 30 hours for me. No, the earth isn't rotating slower than usual, I've just been flying against it's direction for the whole of today. I flew over 12 countries (India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Greenland/Denmark, Canada and finally the US); and 10 states in the US (New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, Nevada and finally California) in the last 30 hours. Somehow, I don't feel all that "jet-lagged", perhaps because my routine at home was upside-down anyway!

Armen and Gary were kind enough to pick me up at the airport, despite the late hour. I've reached Mountain View, and will be crashing at their apartment for tonight because it's too late to check-in. Tomorrow is my first day at Mozilla, which is really exciting, but it also means that I better go to sleep now.
