My exams are finally over, and I should hopefully have completed 2 years of
my engineering! It's a great relief; and despite all the summer of code
proposal preparation, the exams seem to have gone pretty well.

Well, now it's time for the summer, and I think I have a great summer ahead!
First of all, I have an internship at the National University of Singapore.
It's pretty exciting, more so because this will be my first trip abroad, and
it also will be the first time I board a plane. Yay!

I also got a brand new [iPod Nano](http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/)! I haven't
seen it yet, but I will when I get home. I can't wait, the pictures of it on
the Apple site are amazing. I'm figuring out a good way to sync songs to it
on my Gentoo Linux, since iTunes won't work. I've seen some plugins to
[XMMS](http://www.xmms.org/), and [AmaroK](http://amarok.kde.org/) seems to
support iPods too. There's also
[YamiPod](http://www.yamipod.com/main/modules/home/), and
[RhythmBox](http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox/), both of which look
good. I'm a bit sceptic about AmaroK though, i'm a
[GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) fanatic after all. We'll see.

Apart from that, the summer of code results will be announced on 23rd may.
That's pretty exciting too. I sent in my proposals, and am anxiously waiting
for the outcome. I shouldn't get ahead of myself, but in case I do get the
SoC grant, I'm planning to get a nice [Macbook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/).
I think I'm really in love with
Apple. I asked around, and it seems Gentoo Linux works like a charm on the
new Macs. Perfect.

[Scott](http://www.crisscott.com/) also asked Apress to send me a review copy
of [Pro
PHP-GTK](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590596137/102-4045814-3208903?n=283
155). How kind of him, and how exciting for me! It's great to finally see a
book on PHP-GTK, atleast this should make people consider it more seriously.
On the same note, I submitted the draft for a 2-part article on PHP-GTK 2 to
[php|architect](http://www.phparch.com/). Hope they like it, if they do, it's
scheduled to appear in the months of July and August.

All in all, pretty good summer ahead! I'll keep you posted on the happenings
and if the SoC proposal goes through, I'll also open up a nice page for it.
