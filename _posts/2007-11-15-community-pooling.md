[Pradeepto](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071227183654/http://pradeepto.livejournal.com/) put up a [post](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071227183654/http://pradeepto.livejournal.com/9008.html) about how the community can help FOSS organizations scheduled to appear at [FOSS.IN](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071227183654/http://foss.in/) this December. Besides attending the Project Days and Stalls, you can look forward to some cool swag from your favourite organization. Almost every organization is planning on T-Shirts, Stickers and Posters.

These things, unlike knowledge, aren’t free. And I am all for pradeepto’s idea of the community stepping to help. This is all the more important for FOSS.IN, because organizations aren’t allowed to sell anything at the event. The best way, therefore, is for you to get in touch with the co-ordinators of your favorite FOSS organization and ask them how you can help.

Within hours of pradeepto’s post, he received a message from a community member willing to chip in with some dough for the T-Shirts. I find that to be really encouraging. I think it will be a lot easier for us, if, for every T-Shirt/Sticker/Poster we give away, someone would “buy” another. Keep it up, folks!

Oh, and while I’m on the topic, consider this to be a public call for volunteers for the [Gentoo stall](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071227183654/http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/pr/events/foss.in2007-india/index.xml), scheduled for the 6th, 7th, and 8th of December at FOSS.IN. All Volunteers get a free Gentoo T-Shirt (hopefully, paid for by a fellow community member - in any case, myself and fox2mike have the expenses covered for now ;)). So, if you love Gentoo, and will be in Bangalore around that time, there’s no excuse for you not to appear!
