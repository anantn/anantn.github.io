The batteries of my Macbook Pro suddenly  swelled up today. I havenâ€™t a clue in the world as to why it had to  happen all of a sudden today but it did.

Maybe because I gave a hand at programming on the Mac for the first time today. We now have an [installer](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070219120114/http://news.php.net/php.gtk.dev/3674) for PHP-GTK. Intel Mac users only. Was also having a look at [Metisse](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070219120114/http://insitu.lri.fr/metisse/); sounds great. Anyone for a HCI research project?
