After two years of juggling graduate school and Mozilla, I finally joined [Labs](http://mozillalabs.com/) last week to work on amazing projects full-time! Couldn't have asked for a better transition to the "real world" :)

I'm very excited, and I think it's a great sign that on my first day of work I could start hacking right away. I'm indeed very fortunate to be working with some of the most brilliant people I've ever met; on a very meaningful mission of building an open web for the public benefit through innovation.

Stay tuned for more! Oh, and, have you installed the Firefox beta on your [Android/Maemo](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/m/beta) device yet?
