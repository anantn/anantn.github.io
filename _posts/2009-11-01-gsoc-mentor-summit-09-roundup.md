The grand Summer of Code [Mentor Summit of 2009](http://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/index.php/2009) concluded last week and I had the fantastic opportunity of being able to attend on behalf of [Gentoo](http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/gentoo), [Plan 9 ](http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/plan9)and [Mozilla](http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/mozilla). What follows is some indication of how awesome the summit was:

I met so many folks I'd only interacted with online so far (the classic nickname-to-face matching), but even better was the opportunity to meet folks powering open source projects from so many diverse backgrounds. I met many of my personal rockstars, and learned about a bunch of open source projects I'd never heard of :)

Also, one of the things that is only possible at an event like the summit was the ability to get a whole bunch of non-linux operating system groups [in one room](http://twitter.com/anantn/status/5151400159). We had a great [discussion](http://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/index.php/Non-Linux_OS_Meetup), and it resulted in the creation of the "[rosetta-os](http://groups.google.com/group/rosetta-os)" special interest group. Look for more activity on the common device drivers for non-linux operating systems front soon!

Other sessions worthy of special mention were [Open Source Security](http://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/index.php/Open_Source_Security), [Recruiting and Retaining Awesome People](http://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/index.php/Saturday_Sessions_2009/Recruiting_Awesome), Advanced Trolling (yes, you read that right), and of course the always welcoming [Casablanca](http://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/index.php/CasablancaNotes) where I spent most of my time. We discussed everything from our SoC experiences to the Afro Celt Sound System in that room, always full of creative energy and warmth.

After 4 years of participating in the Summer of Code, I am super happy to have finally met the faces behind the program. Every single person I met over the course of last weekend was friendly, intelligent and just generally awesome; that sort of thing doesn't happen by chance. I feel warm and fuzzy inside to think that I'm actually a part of the revolution that is free and open source software, three cheers to everyone that made it possible!
