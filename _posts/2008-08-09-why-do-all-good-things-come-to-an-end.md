Yesterday was my last day at Mozilla Labs, bringing my summer internship to an end. As evidenced by all my posts recently, the summer has been one heck of a ride. I had a great time, and I owe it all to the awesome folks at Mozilla, and my fellow interns.

It's funny how bonds formed in just 3 short months can be so difficult to part from. I would never have imagined that it would be so hard to say goodbye. I take comfort in the fact that I will be seeing many Mozillians again, and I know it's never really goodbye in the Mozilla world - but there are those who I probably won't be seeing ever again - and that makes me really sad.

I guess that's life.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to better times ahead. I hope to continue working with the Labs - so I'll still be around - just not in Mountain View!

As for my immediate plans, after a long flight to Bangalore, I'll be spending a week with family. Sometime during that week, I also have to pick up my VISA for The Netherlands, and then I'm off to Amsterdam for my Masters on the 21st.
