Ok, this post is way too late - but in my defense, I've probably never been this busy! I guess this is a good time to post, as today marks the 3rd [anniversary](http://www.kix.in/blog/2006/02/hello-world-2/) of my blog. Wow, 3 years just flew by. As I go through some of my older posts, I can see how I've changed so much. I guess it's useful to have a blog, some way or the other.

[2008](http://www.kix.in/blog/2008/01/hello-2008/) was simply a phenomenal year for me: [Glendix](http://glendix.org/) was born, I graduated from college, had an [amazing summer](http://www.kix.in/blog/2008/08/why-do-all-good-things-come-to-an-end/) at Mozilla, joined a masters programme at [Amsterdam](http://www.kix.in/blog/2008/08/hallo-uit-amsterdam/), and visited 9 countries. Phew.

After winding up my only exam for the semester, a couple of friends and me headed out to explore Europe during the winter vacations. The experience was extremely overwhelming. Instead of writing anything, I will let some [pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/an_ant/collections/72157612072991401/) do the talking. We visited 5 cities in total: Berlin, Munich, Vienna, Salzburg and Paris. Christmas was spent ice-skating on a nice, snowy night in Munich; New Years eve at the Eiffel tower. I wish I could say there were great fireworks, but I would be lying :(

After returning to Amsterdam I was greeted with deadlines for programming assignments, so I spent most of the month writing a lot of code. Now, February has come,Â  it's a new semester, bringing a whole new wave of course load (taking 6 subjects at the same time!). I'm seriously considering cutting down on a whole lot of extra activity and focus just on the essentials: College, Mozilla and Glendix (in that order). Maybe it is time for me to retire from all the other FOSS projects, I just don't have the luxury of time I had as an undergraduate student any more...

In other news, I am now pretty good at cooking a basic meal: rice and [dal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dal). I've also made [Ghee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghee) from butter with acceptable results twice until now, and the latest attempt even resulted in some delicious '[nei kasandu](http://www.lakshmusings.com/recipes/2008/07/12/nei-kasandu-a-deliciously-simple-way-of-using-leftover-milk-solids-from-making-ghee/)', a typical tamilian snack made from the remnants of the ghee-making. Oh, and I've also picked up a little Dutch; basic phrases like 'Hello', 'Thank you', 'Pardon me', 'I don't understand dutch very well', and 'See you later'. :)

I can't even begin to imagine what 2009 has in store for me, so I'm not going to bother. Here's to a great year 11 months ahead!
